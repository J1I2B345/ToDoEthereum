## Introduction

This is the classic to do list but made with Solidity.

The project was developed with NodeJs, Solidity and Truffle. Besides, Ganache was used to get the blockchain/wallets to test that everything was working.

Following Fazt video on Youtube, the idea was to introduce myself this technologies. It was very interesting how the contract is made and the interaction.

Next step, good practices and Wagmi/ethers.
